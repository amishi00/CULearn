# CULearn
## What it is
Noticing how students on Cornell's campus lack a standard, personalized tutor finding application, we created CULearn. CULearn helps students create a profile as a tutor or a tuttee and find matches based on classes taken, availability, experience, and specific college. Users are also able to filter tutors, chat to find a meeting time, and leave reviews for tutors.

## How we built it
After brainstorming the idea, we used figma to create the underlying design of the app. Then, we built the frontend using SwiftUI and XCode and connected it to the backend APIs that store users information. Languages used: swift and javascript.
